# 🔄 Git Branch Sync Action

This GitHub Action + Bash script automatically syncs remote branches matching a pattern (e.g., `feature/*`) into your local repository.

## 📁 Structure

.github/workflows/sync-branches.yml
scripts/sync-branches.sh


## 🚀 Usage

### 🔧 Manual Trigger via GitHub Actions

Go to **Actions > Sync Remote Branches > Run workflow**, then provide:

- `pattern`: Branch pattern like `feature/*`, `bugfix/*`, etc.
- `dry_run`: `true` to preview without applying
- `force`: `true` to force checkout even with local changes
- `verbose`: `true` to enable debug logging

---

### 💡 Authentication

This action supports both HTTPS (via PAT) and SSH.

#### Option 1: PAT (Personal Access Token)

1. Go to [GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Create a classic token with `repo` scope
3. Add it to your repo as a secret named `PAT_TOKEN`

#### Option 2: SSH Key

1. Generate key:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-action@yourdomain.com"

2. Add the public key to your GitHub account under SSH Keys
3. Add the private key to repo secrets as SSH_PRIVATE_KEY
If both are present, SSH will be prioritized.

## Local Development
You can also run the sync script locally:
    ```bash
    ./scripts/sync-branches.sh --pattern "feature/*" --dry-run --verbose

## Security

No credentials are hardcoded.

SSH and PAT are passed via GitHub Secrets.

Always restrict token scopes to minimum required.
